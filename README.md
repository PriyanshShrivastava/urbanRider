# urbanRider
urbanRider is a bike rental service created and designed by me. This is a part of a HTML and CSS project series that I am creating. This is a responsive site created taken into account almost every possible screen size.

Technology used:
HTML
CSS
Vanilla JavaScript

I have created this site keeping in mind all the best practices and also taking performance to be the top priority. Here are some of the images of how the site looks in different screensizes :

In order to make it performant and eye pleasing, I have used several tools and resources to design and create it, here they are:

1. Canva (for designing purpose)
2. Squoosh( for compressing and resizing the images)
3. ionicons(icon pack)
4. Unsplash and pexel (for free stock images of high quality)
5. OnBikes (site inspiration)
6 colorhunt (color selection)
7. tint and shades (for getting all the tints and shades of any color).
